TEAM C - repo checkout 15d7f11

## Team submission

_Instructions for installing are not correct. Have to be in subfolder to install. backend/frontend folders not explained in README. Futher instructions later other README provided clarification. Can you deprecate the confusing extra README files? Which ones do I read?_

_Backend unit tests hang after passing - there seems to be an async problem to be resolved_

_No access to performance reviews. Could not find code reviews._

_You are missing a clear statement of what I am suppossed to see when I run the project. What is the overall state of the project product right now???_


Total: (74/100)


Team submission evaluation will be based on the following:

* The README file in your repo will be read by the evaluator to run the program, unit tests, and find out what other documentation the evaluator should read.
  * The content of the Kanban Board, issue tracker, and repo will be reviewed, but you may need to identify particular uses (of KanBan cards, issue tracker or other documentation tools) in your process documents or README.
  * Other documents can/should be put in a documents folder in your repo
  * If you are using other github tools that need to be reviewed (e.g. discussion or wiki tools) make sure this is made clear to the evaluator in the repo README file.

* Evaluation components will include:
  * (10/10%) Are the SCRUM meetings documented and all decisions documented properly and reflected in the Kanban Board and the issue tracker? Are decisions recorded in manner that provides for validation and traceability?
  * (0/10%) Are progress (individual tasks), performance (how did the team members perform) and code reviews conducted and documented, including the following:
  _I could not find these code reviews or access the perf reviews_
    * This should be the primary agenda of the end-of-sprint SCRUM meeting.
    * Each code task has been code reviewed explicitly
    * Each team member has been performance reviewed explicitly (identify them)
    * The review process (x2) is identified, and may include a checklist for guidance and normalizing the review activity.
    * The process should be clear and concise, allowing the opportunity for the individual to respond to specific problems. (a full page of criticism is too long.)
    * Issues that arise from code and/or performance review are noted in the board.
  * (38/50%) Are the appropriate process elements established, followed and documented
    * (5/5%) meetings conducted appropriate contributions, with roles, notes and all decisions documented
    * (5/5%) Scrummaster and notetaker roles properly conducted and circulated among team members
    * (0/5%) Current architecture and technology base (languages, modules, packages, tools) for project design described (including diagrams where needed) 
    _I saw something extensive front end, not so much for back end. Where is the docs for backend architecture?_
    * (0/5%) pull request deadlines and process and other workflow elements (git workflow) described and enforced for all team members
    _I don't see them stated anywhere. Did I miss it?_
    * (3/5%) code review standards clear and identified (possibly using a checklist) encapsulating principles from lecture materials (DRY, SOLID, etc.) updated and enforced by review
    _You don;t include programming principles as far as I can see. Fix this._
    * (25/25%) documentation, Kanban Board and issue tracker
      * labels and organization of issues in the tracker and cards on the board should be clear to the evaluator.
      * Completeness - the progress of tasks and issue status are clear from the board.
      * Labels have been modified for the team process. Labels help distinguish types of issues and tasks.
      * The board is clearly being used to update status and labels of tasks, and new cards identifying issues that arise are posted. 
      * Kanban task documentation can be linked to other more detailed documentation via card comments and web/http links.
  * (8/10%) Are any problems with the team progress, dynamics and process identified and documented along with status of these issues being clearly indicated
  	Project problems do not seem to generate new kanban cards when you find them. Why not?_
  * (18/20%) Unit testing
    * unit testing has been incorporated into code review and completed successfully for all coding tasks.
    _some front end tests are failing. Explanation of why failing code has passed pull request is not provided._

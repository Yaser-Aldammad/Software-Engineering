## Project Description
> ### Frontend
>
> The frontend part of the project renders the webpages on the client. It will be connected with the backend to perform the CRUD operations(Create, Read, Update, Delete) using various REST APIs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) respectively, and store them into the MongoDB Database.
>
> _All the frontend files are in the folder [frontend/](https://github.com/MUN-COMP6905/project-cteam/tree/master/frontend)_
>
> #### Frontend Code Run Instructions
> To run frontend code, kindly follow the given instructions:
>
> - Clone this repository
>
> ```git
> git clone https://github.com/MUN-COMP6905/project-cteam
>```
>
> - Run the backend server
>
>```cmd
> cd .\project-team\backend
> npm install
> npm run watch
>```
>
> - Go to the frontend folder
>
>```cmd
> cd .\project-cteam\frontend
> ```
>
> - Install the dependencies from `package.json`
>
> ```cmd
> npm install
> ```
>
> - To start the server, run:
>
> ```cmd
> npm run frontend
> ```
>
> - To run the tests, simply run in the frontend folder:
>
> ```cmd
> npm test
>```
>
> The app will listen to http://localhost:8080

### Backend
- Creating RESTful APIs: Express is often used to create RESTful APIs that can
  be consumed by frontend applications or mobile apps. It provides features like
  routing, middleware, and error handling that make it easy to build and
  maintain APIs.
- In an MVC architecture with Express.js, the application can be structured as
  follows:

  - Model: This represents the data and business logic of the application. It
    includes data access, validation, and processing. You can use libraries like
    Mongoose or Sequelize to define and interact with the database.

  - View: This represents the user interface of the application. It includes the
    HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that the user sees and interacts with. You
    can use templates like EJS, Pug, or Handlebars to render dynamic HTML.

  - Controller: This acts as an intermediary between the model and view. It
    receives user requests, processes them, and updates the model and view
    accordingly. You can define controller functions using Express.js routing
    and middleware functions.

## API Documentation
*  Base URL: The base URL for all endpoints is: http://localhost:3000/v1
*  Authentication: QuizApp uses JWT(JSON Web Tokens) and Passport to authenticate access to API endpoints in an Express.js application.

   * POST /example
   * Parameters:
       * first_name (required)

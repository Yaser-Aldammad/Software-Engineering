Prabin 
	- presented an overview of the  Software Principles & Methodology that the documentation team discussed
	  during their meeting earlier in the day
	- demo'd how to define sprints, tasks (issues in Github) and subtasks, and the correct way to label
          their status/progress in the sprint cycle

Shaher
	- presented an overview of the current backend codebase, and demo'd the creation/addition of a user
	  account


it would seem that at present the team is organized as such:

	- Pranav
	- Yaser

backend
	- Shaher (team lead)
	- Prabin
	- Yaser
	- Judah

documentation team
	- Prabin
	- Yaser
	- Judah

kanban board manager/scrum master
	- Prabin/Yaser (most combined experience in ~prod. mgmt.)

code reviewers
	- respective team leads for frontend/backend

documentation
	- everyone (each person does low-level documentation for their code)
	- as for high level project architecture/code documentation (module composition, file structure
          layout), team leads should work with members to design this


objectives
- we need to clarify a few things from the professor on Monday
	- scope of project and specific expectations (todo) for assignment 2
	- details about mechanism for performance review and code review

- documentation team needs to finalize the templates/standards for architecture & code design, 
  documentation and code review so all team members have a reference for these processes

- documentation team needs to start implementing task creation process and task assignment to team members

Judah
	- gave a live demo of how user stories/features/issues should be created on the Kanban board
	

objectives
- Pranav and Shaher should finalize pushing the boilerplate code for the FED and BED, respectively 
- Shaher and Judah will be meeting in the night to create the backend tasks for milestone 2, and assign them to team members
	- once tasks are on the board, members can view and meet with Shaher to discuss feasibility of taking 	on tasks
- we still need to clarify once and for all (ideally in an all-hands meeting) the source submission process (branches for user stories/features) and the flow of pushes/pull requests
	- Prabin and Shaher will be spearheading this
- team members that have not added their `requested` user story and 2 features spanning from the user story should do so
- Judah will be adding links to the working drafts for the documentation tasks; all team members are open to contribute to these

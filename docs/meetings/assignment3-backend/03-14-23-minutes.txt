Agenda: First "SCRUM" meeting of the team for assignment 3 sprint.

Action Items:

- First "SCRUM" meeting of the team; the team decided that there will be a separate meeting for frontend and backend team. So this was from the backend side:
	- we went over the requirements for assign3
		- unit/regression testing for prior tasks and newly assigned tasks for assign3
		- task creation/assignment for assign3
- each member should think up tasks that they would like to work on (may be related to their existing task from Sprint2, or different); consult with Shaher
- Shaher will create the sample jest test cases, and share with all members
- in the meanwhile, members can read up on the jest documentation and how to create unit tests for their tasks
- Discussion on adding a test script:
	- Pranav and Shaher discussed to have a script that can populate a few documents in all the collections of the MongoDB database.
	- This will load up a few entries that will be rendered to the frontend.
	- Discussion of creating use cases dynamically using seed data route.
	- Providing the testing json data file that can be used to connect REST APIs between frontend and backend.

Agenda: Disscusion on the previous meeting agenda and Unit testing

Action items: 

1. There is an issue in storing a token in localstorage and retrieve on the quiz page. We have to solve that during this meeting.
2. The issue has been solved and localstorage can set and get JWT now.
3. Discussion on Unit testing. Which testing framework to use?
4. Pranav said to use Mocha testing as we used that in the assignment 1. However, Balsher had a disagreement and suggested to use JEST as the backend is already using jest so there will be consistency throughout the project.
5. Final Decision: To use JEST in frontend testing as well.

Follow-up actions: Fimiliarize how to use JEST on the webpage testing. Also dividing the unit testing features and code tasks.
